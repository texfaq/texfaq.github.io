# Where to find FAQs

Bobby Bodenheimer's article, from which this FAQ was developed, used
to be posted (nominally monthly) to newsgroup
`comp.text.tex`. The (long
obsolete) last posted copy of that article is kept on CTAN for
auld lang syne.

The sources of the present FAQ
are available from CTAN.

This FAQ and others are regularly mentioned, on
`comp.text.tex` and elsewhere, in a ''pointer FAQ''
which is also saved at [http://tug.org/tex-ptr-faq]

A 2006 innovation from Scott Pakin is the ''visual'' LaTeX FAQ.
This is a document with (mostly rubbish) text formatted so as to
highlight things we discuss here, and providing Acrobat hyper-links to
the relevant answers in this FAQ on the Web.  The visual
FAQ is provided in PDF format, on CTAN; it works
best using Adobe Acrobat Reader 7 (or later); some features are
missing with other readers, or with earlier versions of Acrobat Reader

Another excellent information source, available in English, is the
[(La)TeX navigator](http://tex.loria.fr).

Both the Francophone TeX user group Gutenberg and the Czech/Slovak
user group CS-TUG have published translations of this FAQ, with
extensions appropriate to their languages.

The Open Directory Project (ODP) maintains a list of sources of
(La)TeX help, including FAQs.  View the TeX area at

  A FAQ used to be posted regularly to
  `fr.comp.text.tex`, and is archived on CTAN&nbsp;&mdash;
  sadly, that effort seems to have fallen by the wayside.
