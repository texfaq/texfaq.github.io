# (Modern) Windows systems

Windows users nowadays have a real choice, between two excellent
distributions, MiKTeX and TeX&nbsp;Live.  TeX&nbsp;Live on windows has
only in recent years been a real challenger to the long-established
MiKTeX, and even now MiKTeX has features that TeX&nbsp;Live lacks.
Both are comprehensive
distributions, offering all the established TeX variants (TeX,
PDFTeX&nbsp;&mdash; both with &epsilon;-TeX variants&nbsp;&mdash; as well as XeTeX and
LuaTeX), together with a wide range of support tools.

Both MiKTeX and TeX&nbsp;Live offer management tools, including the
means of keeping an installation ''up-to-date'', by reinstalling
packages that have been updated on CTAN (the delay between a
package update appearing, and it being available to the distribution
users) can be as short as a day (and is never very long).

MiKTeX, by Christian Schenk, is the longer-established of the pair,
and has a large audience of satisfied users; TeX&nbsp;Live is the
dominant distribution in use in the world of Unix-like systems, and so
its Windows version may be expected to appeal to those who use both
Unix-like and Windows systems.  The latest release of MiKTeX&nbsp;&mdash;
version 2.9&nbsp;&mdash; requires Windows&nbsp;XP, or later (so it does not work on
Windows&nbsp;2000 or earlier).

Both distributions may be used in a configuration which involves no
installation at all.  MiKTeX's ''portable'' distribution may be
unpacked on a memory stick, and used on any windows computer without
making any direct use of the hard drive.  The web page 
[TeX&nbsp;Live portable usage](http://www.tug.org/texlive/portable.html)
describes the options for installing TeX&nbsp;Live on a memory stick, or
for using the TeX&nbsp;Live DVD with no installation at all.

Both MiKTeX and TeX&nbsp;Live may be downloaded and installed, package
by package, over the net.  This is a mammoth undertaking, only to be
undertaken by those with a good network connection (and a patient
disposition!).

A ready-to-run copy of the MiKTeX distribution,
on DVD may be bought via the 
[MiKTeX web site](http://www.miktex.org/cd/).  MiKTeX may
also be installed using ProTeXt, on the 
[TeX Collection DVD](./FAQ-CD.html).

The [TeX Collection DVD](./FAQ-CD.html) also provides an
offline installer for TeX&nbsp;Live.

A further (free) option is available thanks to the
[CygWin bundle](http://www.cygwin.com), which presents a
Unix-like environment in Windows systems (and also provides an
X-windows server).  The (now obsolete) teTeX distribution is
provided as part of the CygWin distribution, but there is a CygWin
build of TeX&nbsp;Live so you can have a current TeX system.  TeX
under CygWin is reputedly somewhat slower than native Win32
implementations such as MiKTeX, and of course the TeX
applications behave like Unix-system applications.

BaKoMa TeX, by Basil Malyshev, is a comprehensive (shareware)
distribution, which focuses on support of Acrobat.  The distribution
comes with a bunch of Type&nbsp;1 fonts packaged to work with BaKoMa
TeX, which further the focus.
