# WEB systems for various languages

TeX is written in the programming language WEB; WEB
is a tool to implement the concept of ''literate programming''.
Knuth's original implementation will be in any respectable
distribution of TeX, but the sources of the two tools
(`tangle` and `weave`), together with a manual
outlining the programming techniques, may be had from CTAN.

`CWEB`, by Silvio Levy, is a WEB for C programs.

`FWEB`, by John Krommes, is a version for Fortran,
Ratfor,C, C++, working with LaTeX; it was derived
from `CWEB`.

Spidery WEB, by Norman Ramsey, supports many 
languages including Ada, `awk`, and C
and, while not in the public domain, is usable without charge.  It is
now superseded by `noweb` (also by Norman Ramsay) which
incorporates the lessons learned in implementing spidery WEB,
and which is a simpler, equally powerful, tool.

`Scheme``WEB`, by John Ramsdell, is a Unix filter that
translates SchemeWEB into LaTeX source or Scheme source.

`APLWEB` is a version of WEB for APL.

`FunnelWeb` is a version of WEB that is language independent.

Other language independent versions of WEB are `nuweb` (which
is written in ANSI C).

`Tweb` is a WEB for Plain TeX macro files, using
`noweb`.
