# Getting help online

We assume, here, that you have looked at all relevant
[FAQ answers](./FAQ-whereFAQ.html) you can find, you've looked in
any [books](./FAQ-book-lists.html) you have, and scanned relevant
[tutorials](./FAQ-tutorials*.html)&hellip; and still you don't know what
to do.

There are two more steps you can take before formulating a question to
the TeX world at large.

First, (if you are seeking a particular package or program), start by
looking on your own system: you might already have what you seek&nbsp;&mdash;
the better TeX distributions provide a wide range of supporting
material.  The [CTAN Catalogue](./FAQ-catalogue.html) can also
identify packages that might help: you can 
[search it](http://www.tex.ac.uk/search), or you can browse it
''[by topic](http://mirrors.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html)''.
Each catalogue entry has a brief description of the package, and links to
known documentation on the net.  In fact, a large proportion of
CTAN package directories now include documentation, so it's
often worth looking at the catalogue entry for a package you're considering
using (where possible, each package link in the main body of these
FAQs has a link to
the relevant catalogue entry).

Failing that, look to see if anyone has solved the problem before;
places where people ask are:
  

1.  newsgroup `comp.text.tex`, whose ''historical posts''
    are accessible via
    [Google groups](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex),
    and
2.  the mailing list `texhax` via its
    [archive](http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/), or via the 'Gmane'
    newsgroup `gmane.comp.tex.texhax`, which holds a
    _very_ long history of the list.  A long shot would be to
    search the archives of the mailing list's ancient posts on
    CTAN, which go back to the days when it was a digest: in
    those days, a question asked in one issue would only ever be
    answered in the next one.

If the ''back question'' searches fail, you must ask the world at
large.

So, how do you like to ask questions?&nbsp;&mdash; the three available
mechanisms are:
  

1.  Mailing lists: there are various specialist mailing lists, but
    the place for 'general' (La)TeX queries is the `texhax`
    mailing list.  Mail to <a href="mailto:texhax@tug.org">texhax@tug.org</a> to ask a question,
    but it's probably better to subscribe to the list
    (via [http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax]) 
    first&nbsp;&mdash; not everyone will answer to you as well as to the list.
2.  Newsgroup: to ask a question on `comp.text.tex`, you
    can use your own news client (if you have one), or use the ''+ new
    post'' button on
    [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex].
3.  Web forum: alternatives are: the 
    [''LaTeX community'' site](http://www.latex-community.org/),
    which offers a variety of 'categories' to place your query, and the
    [TeX, LaTeX and friends [[[&]]] site](http://tex.stackexchange.com/)
    (''StackExchange'').
  

    StackExchange has a scheme for voting on the quality of answers (and
    hence of those who offer support).  This arrangement is supposed to
    enable you to rank any answers that are posted.
  

    StackExchange offers
    [hints about ''good behaviour''](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1436/welcome-to-tex-sx),
    which any user should at least scan before asking for help there.
    (The hints' principal aim is to maximise the chance that you get useful
    advice from the first answer; for example, it suggests that you supply a
    [minimal example of your problem](./FAQ-askquestion.html), just as
    these FAQs do.  There are people on the site who can be abrasive
    to those asking questions, who seem not to be following the
    guidelines for good behaviour)

Do *not* try mailing the LaTeX project team, the maintainers
of the TeX&nbsp;Live or MiKTeX distributions or the maintainers of
these FAQs for help; while all these addresses reach
experienced (La)TeX users, no small group can possibly have
expertise in every area of usage so that the ''big'' lists and forums
are a far better bet.
