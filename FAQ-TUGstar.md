# TeX User Groups

There has been a TeX User Group since very near the time TeX
first appeared.  That first group, TUG, is still active and its
journal _TUGboat_ continues in regular publication
with articles about TeX, MetaFont and related technologies, and about
document design, processing and production.  TUG holds a yearly
conference, whose proceedings are published in _TUGboat_.

TUG's [web site](http://www.tug.org) is a valuable
resource for all sorts of
TeX-related matters, such as details of TeX software, and lists
of TeX vendors and TeX consultants.  Back articles from
_TUGboat_ are also available.

Some time ago, TUG established a ''technical council'', whose
task was to oversee the development of TeXnical projects.  Most
such projects nowadays go on their way without any support from
TUG, but TUG's web site lists its

[Technical Working Groups (TWGs)](http://www.tug.org/twg.html).

TUG has a reasonable claim to be considered a world-wide
organisation, but there are many national and regional user groups,
too; TUG's web site maintains a list of
[''Local User Groups'' (LUGs)](http://www.tug.org/lugs.html).
