# Capacity exceeded&nbsp;&mdash; input levels

The error
```latex
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [text input levels=15].
```
is caused by nesting your input too deeply.  You can provoke it with
the trivial (Plain TeX) file `input.tex`, which contains
nothing but: 
```latex
\input input
```
In the real world, you are unlikely to encounter the error with a
modern TeX distribution.  TeTeX (used to produce the error
message above) allows 15 files open for TeX input at any one time,
which is improbably huge for a document generated by real human
beings.

However, for those improbable (or machine-generated) situations,
some distributions offer the opportunity to adjust the parameter
`max_in_open` in a configuration file.
