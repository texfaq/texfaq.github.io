# Macintosh systems

The [TeX collection](./FAQ-CD.html) DVD includes MacTeX,
which is a Mac-tailored version of TeX&nbsp;Live; details may be found on
the [TUG web site](http://tug.org/mactex).  If you don't
have the disc, you can download the distribution from CTAN (but
note that it's pretty big).  MacTeX is an instance of TeX&nbsp;Live,
and has a Mac-tailored graphical TeX&nbsp;Live manager, so that you can
keep your distribution up-to-date.

Note that installing MacTeX requires `root` privilege.  This
is a pity, since it offers several extras that aren't available via a
standard TeX&nbsp;Live, which aren't therefore available to ''ordinary
folk'' at work.  For those who don't have `root` privilege, the
option is to install using the TeX&nbsp;Live `tlinstall` utility.

[OzTeX](http://www.trevorrow.com/oztex/), by Andrew Trevorrow,
is a shareware version of TeX for the Macintosh.  A DVI
previewer and PostScript driver are also included.
OzTeX is a Carbon app, so will run under Mac OS/X (see
[http://www.trevorrow.com/oztex/ozosx.html] for details), but it
is _not_ a current version: it doesn't even offer PDFTeX.  A
mailing list is provided by TUG: sign up via
[http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/oztex]

Another partly shareware program is
[CMacTeX](http://www.kiffe.com/cmactex.html), put together by
Tom Kiffe.  CMacTeX is much closer than OzTeX to the Unix TeX
model of things (it uses `dvips`, for instance).  CMacTeX
runs natively under Mac OS/X; it includes a port of a version of
[Omega](./FAQ-omegaleph.html).

  Further information may be available in the 
  [MacTeX wiki](http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/).
The MacTeX-on-OS&nbsp;X mailing list is another useful resource for
