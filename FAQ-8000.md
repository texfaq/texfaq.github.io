# Mismatched mode ljfour and resolution 8000

You're running `dvips`, and you encounter a stream of error
messages, starting with `Mismatched mode`.  The mode is the
default used in your installation&nbsp;&mdash; it's set in the `dvips`
configuration file, and `ljfour` is commonest (since it's the
default in most distributions), but not invariable.

The problem is that `dvips` has encountered a font for which
it must generate a bitmap (since it can't find it in Type&nbsp;1 format),
and there is no proforma available to provide instructions to give to
MetaFont.

So what to do?  The number 8000 comes from the `-Ppdf` option
to `dvips`, which you might have found from the answer
[''wrong type of fonts''](./FAQ-fuzzy-type3.html).  The obvious
solution is to switch to the trivial substitute `-Pwww`,
which selects the necessary type&nbsp;1 fonts for PDF generation,
but nothing else: however, this will leave you with undesirable bitmap
fonts in your PDF file.  The ''proper'' solution is to find a
way of expressing what you want to do, using type&nbsp;1 fonts.
