# Shortcuts to installing files




There are circumstances in which most of the fuss of installation can
be bypassed:
  

-  If you are a MiKTeX user, the 
    [MiKTeX package management system](./FAQ-inst-miktex*.html)
    can usually help;
-  Similarly, if you are a TeX&nbsp;Live user, the 
    [TeX&nbsp;Live manager](./FAQ-inst-texlive.html)
    can usually help;
-  The package you want may already exist as a ZIP file
    formatted for [direct installation](./FAQ-inst-tds-zip.html).
