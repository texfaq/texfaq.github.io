# What is &epsilon;-TeX?

The &epsilon;-TeX extensions to TeX are a range of new functionalities
added by the NTS to Knuth's original TeX program: see [details of
engine developments](/FAQ-enginedev) for more.

In a modern TeX distribution, the extensions are enabled for almost all formats
except Knuth's TeX (`tex`) itself. As such, most users will never use a
system _not_ featuring &epsilon;-TeX: indeed, LaTeX2e has required them since
2017.
