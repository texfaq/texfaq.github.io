# Installing things on a (La)TeX system

Installing (or replacing) things on your (La)TeX system has the
potential to be rather complicated; the following questions attempt to
provide a step-by-step approach, starting from the point where you've
decided what it is that you want to install:
  

-  You must [find the file you need](/FAQ-install-find);
-  If you are going to install a LaTeX package, you may need to
    [unpack the distributed files](/FAQ-install-unpack);
-  It may be necessary to 
    [generate some documentation to read](/FAQ-install-doc);
-  You need to 
    [decide where to install the files](/FAQ-install-where);
-  You must now [install the files](/FAQ-inst-wlcf); and
    finally
-  You may need to [tidy up](/FAQ-inst-tidy) after the installation.
