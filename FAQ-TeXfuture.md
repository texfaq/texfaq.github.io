# What is the future of TeX?

Knuth has declared that he will do no further development of TeX;
he will continue to fix any bugs that are reported to him (though
bugs are rare).  This decision was made soon after
TeX version&nbsp;3.0 was released; at each bug-fix release
the version number acquires one more digit, so that it tends to the
limit&nbsp;&pi; (at the time of writing, Knuth's latest release
is version 3.1415926).  Knuth wants TeX to be frozen at
version&nbsp;&pi; when he dies; thereafter, no further changes
may be made to Knuth's source.  (A similar rule is applied to MetaFont;
its version number tends to the limit&nbsp;_e_, and currently
stands at 2.718281.)

Knuth explains his decision, and exhorts us all to respect it, in a
paper originally published in 
[TUGboat 11(4)](http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf),
and reprinted in the 
[NTG journal MAPS](http://www.ntg.nl/maps/pdf/5_34.pdf).

There are projects (some of them long-term
projects: see, for example,
[the LaTeX3 project](./FAQ-LaTeX3.html))
to build substantial new macro packages based on TeX.  There are
also various projects to build a _successor_ to TeX.  The
[&epsilon;-TeX](./FAQ-etex.html) extension to TeX itself arose from such a
project (NTS).  Another pair of projects, which have delivered
all the results they are likely to deliver, is the
related 
[Omega and Aleph](./FAQ-omegaleph.html).  The 
[XeTeX system](./FAQ-xetex.html) is in principle still under
development, but is widely used, and the 
[LuaTeX project](./FAQ-luatex.html) (though not scheduled to produce
for some time) has already delivered a system that increasingly
accessible to ''ordinary users''.
