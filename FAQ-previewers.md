# DVI previewers

EmTeX for PCs running MS-DOS or OS/2, MiKTeX and
XEmTeX for PCs running Windows and OzTeX for the Macintosh, all
come with previewers that can be used on those platforms. EmTeX's
previewer can also be run under Windows&nbsp;3.1.

Commercial PC TeX packages (see 
[commercial vendors](./FAQ-commercial.html))
have good previewers for PCs running Windows, or for Macintoshes.

For Unix systems, there is one 'canonical' viewer, `xdvi`.
`Xdvik` is a version of `xdvi` using the
`web2c` libraries; it is now built from the same distribution
as `xdvi`.  The TeX&nbsp;Live distributions for Unix systems
include a version of `xdvik`.

Alternatives to previewing include
  

-  conversion to 'similar' ASCII text (see
    [converting to ASCII](./FAQ-toascii.html)) and using a
    conventional text viewer to look at that,
-  generating a PostScript version of your document and viewing it
    with a
    [`ghostscript`](http://www.ghostscript.com/)-based
    previewer (see 
    [previewing PostScript files](./FAQ-PSpreview.html)), and
-  generating  PDF output, and viewing that with
    `Acrobat` `Reader` or one of the substitutes for that.
