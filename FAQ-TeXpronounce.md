# How should I pronounce ''TeX''?

The 'X' is ''really'' the Greek letter 
Chi, and is pronounced by
English-speakers either a bit like the 'ch' in the Scots word 'loch'
([x] in the IPA) or (at a pinch, if you can't do the Greek sound) like
'k'.  It definitely is not pronounced 'ks' (the Greek letter with that
sound doesn't look remotely like the Latin alphabet 'X').

This curious usage derives from Knuth's explanation in the TeXbook
that the name comes from the Greek word for 'art' or 'craft'
('_techni_'),
which is the root of the English word 'technology'.  Knuth's logo for TeX is
merely the uppercase version of the first three (Greek) letters of the
word, jiggled about a bit; we don't use that logo (and logos like it)
in this FAQ (see 
[Typesetting TeX-related logos](./FAQ-logos.html)).
