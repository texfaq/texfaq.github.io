# LaTeX3 programming


As yet, there is no book ''Programming in LaTeX3'', and even if
such a thing existed there would be lots of gaps.  So there is no
_comprehensive_ support.


However, there are some 'resources':
  

-  The ''introduction to LaTeX3 ideas'' in the [`expl3`](http://ctan.org/pkg/expl3)
    documentation gives a broad-brush overview of the concepts.
-  Joseph Wright has written a short series of 
    [blog posts](http://www.texdev.net/index.php?s=programming+latex3),
    which may help.
-  There is also a complete command reference in the
    [`interface3`](http://ctan.org/pkg/interface3) document.




The documents are still subject to development; some of the broader
design issues are discussed on the LaTeX mailing list
`latex-l`&nbsp;&mdash; you may subscribe to that list by sending a
message by sending a message
  `subscribe latex-l <_your name_>`
