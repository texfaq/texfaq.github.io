# Other systems' TeX availability

For PCs, running MS-DOS or OS/2, EmTeX (by Eberhard
Mattes) offers LaTeX, BibTeX, previewers, and drivers.  It is
available as a series of zip archives, with documentation in both
German and English.  Appropriate memory managers for using emTeX
with 386 (and better) processors and under pre-'9x Windows, are
included in the distribution.  (EmTeX _can_ be made to operate
under Windows, but even back when it was ''current'', such use wasn't
very actively encouraged.)

A version of emTeX, packaged to use a 
[TDS directory structure](./FAQ-tds.html), is separately available as an
emTeX 'contribution'.  Note that neither emTeX itself, nor
emTeX-TDS, is maintained.  Users of Microsoft operating
systems, who want an up-to-date (La)TeX system, need Win32-based
systems.

For PCs, running MS-DOS, a further option is a port of the
Web2C&nbsp;7.0 implementation, using the GNU `djgpp`
compiler.  While this package is more recent than emTeX, it
nevertheless also offers a rather old instance of (La)TeX.

For VAX systems running OpenVMS, a TeX distribution
is available CTAN, but is almost certainly not the latest (it
is more than 10 years old).  Whether a version is even available for
current VMS (which typically runs on Intel 64-bit processors)
is not clear, but it seems unlikely.

For the Atari ST and TT, CS-TeX is available
from CTAN; it's offered as a set of ZOO archives.

Amiga users have the option of a full implementations of TeX 3.1
(PasTeX) and MetaFont 2.7.

It's less likely that hobbyists would be running TOPS-20
machines, but since TeX was originally written on a DEC-10
under WAITS, the TOPS-20 port is another near approach
to Knuth's original environment. Sources are available by anonymous
