# Commercial TeX implementations

There are many commercial implementations of TeX. The first
appeared not long after TeX itself appeared.

What follows is probably an incomplete list.  Naturally, no warranty or
fitness for purpose is implied by the inclusion of any vendor in this
list.  The source of the information is given to provide some clues to
its currency.

In general, a commercial implementation will come 'complete', that is,
with suitable previewers and printer drivers.  They normally also have
extensive documentation (_i.e_., not just the TeXbook!) and some
sort of support service.  In some cases this is a toll free number
(probably applicable only within the USA and or Canada), but others
also have email, and normal telephone and fax support.

Note that the company Y&Y has gone out of business, and Y&Y
TeX (and support for it) is therefore no longer available.  Users
of Y&Y systems may care to use the self-help
[mailing list](http://tug.org/pipermail/yandytex/)
that was established in 2003; the remaining usable content of
Y&Y's web site is available at [http://www.tug.org/yandy/]
