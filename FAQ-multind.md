# Multiple indexes

LaTeX's standard indexing capabilities (those provided by the
[`makeidx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/makeidx) package) only provide for one index in your
document; even quite modest documents can be improved by indexes for
separate topics.

The [`multind`](https://ctan.org/pkg/multind) package provides simple and straightforward
multiple indexing.  You tag each `\makeindex`, `\index` and
`\printindex` command with a file name, and indexing commands are
written to (or read from) the name with the appropriate (`idx` or
`ind`) extension appended.  The `\printindex` command is modified
from an old version of the LaTeX 2.09 standard so that it doesn't
create its own chapter or section heading; you therefore decide what
names (or sectioning level, even) to use for the indexes, and
[`\indexname`](FAQ-fixnam.md) is completely ignored.

To create a ''general'' and an ''authors'' index, one might write:
```latex
\usepackage{multind}
\makeindex{general}
\makeindex{authors}
...
\index{authors}{Eccentric Professor}
...
\index{general}{FAQs}
...
\printindex{general}{General index}
\printindex{authors}{Author index}
```
To complete the job, run LaTeX on your file enough times that
labels, etc., are stable, and then execute the commands
```latex
makeindex general
makeindex authors
```
before running LaTeX again.  Note that the names of the index files
to process are not necessarily related to the name of the LaTeX
file you're processing, at all.  (There's no documentation that comes
with the package: what you see above is as good as you will
get&hellip;)

The [`multind`](https://ctan.org/pkg/multind) package doesn't work with the 
[AMSLaTeX classes](FAQ-AMSpkg.md), but the AMS provide a
substitute, the [`amsmidx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmidx) package.  You use the
[`amsmidx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmidx) package pretty much the same as you would
[`multind`](https://ctan.org/pkg/multind), but if things aren't clear, there _is_
documentation (unlike [`multind`](https://ctan.org/pkg/multind)).

The [`index`](https://ctan.org/pkg/index) package provides a comprehensive set of indexing
facilities, including a `\newindex` command that allows the
definition of new styles of index.  `\newindex` takes a ''tag'' (for
use in indexing commands), replacements for the `idx` and
`ind` file extensions, and a title for the index when it's
finally printed; it can also change the item that's being indexed
against (for example, one might have an index of artists referenced by
the figure number where their work is shown).

Using [`index`](https://ctan.org/pkg/index), to create an author index together with a
''normal'' index, one would start with preamble commands:
```latex
\usepackage{index}
\makeindex
\newindex{aut}{adx}{and}{Name Index}
```
which load the package, define a ''main'' (original-style) index, and
then define an author index.  Then, in the body of the document, we
might find commands like:
```latex
\index[aut]{Another Idiot}
...
\index{FAQs}
```
Which place an entry in the author index, and then one in the main
index.  At the end of the document, we have two commands:
```latex
\printindex
\printindex[aut]
```
Which will print the main index and then the author index.  Supposing
this lot to be in `myfile.tex`, after enough runs through
LaTeX that labels are stable, execute the following commands
(Unix-style shell commands shown here, but the principle is the same
whatever system you're using):
```latex
makeindex myfile
makeindex myfile.adx -o myfile.and
```
and rerun LaTeX.  The `makeindex` commands process
`myfile.idx` to `myfile.ind` (the default action), and then
`myfile.adx` to `myfile.and`, the two files needed as input
by the two `\printindex` commands in `myfile.tex`.

The [`splitidx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/splitindex) package can operate in the same way as the
others: load the package with the `split` option, and
declare each index with a `\newindex` command:
  `\newindex[&lsaquo;_index name_&rsaquo;]{&lsaquo;_shortcut_&rsaquo;}`
and [`splitidx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/splitindex) will generate a file
`\jobname``.&lsaquo;_shortcut_&rsaquo;` to receive index entries
generated by commands like `\sindex[&lsaquo;_shortcut_&rsaquo;]{&lsaquo;_item_&rsaquo;}`.
As with the other packages, this method is limited by TeX's total
number of output files.  However, [`splitindex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/splitindex) also comes with
a small executable `splitindex` (available for a variety of
operating systems); if you use this auxiliary program (and don't use
`split`), there's no limit to the number of indexes.  Apart
from this trick, [`splitidx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/splitindex) supports the same sorts of things
as does [`index`](https://ctan.org/pkg/index).  An example of use appears in
the documentation.

The [`imakeidx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/imakeidx) package can do a wide range of things (in particular,
it can run an index-builder&nbsp;&mdash; via 
[`\write18` commands](FAQ-spawnprog.md)&nbsp;&mdash; so as to simplify
business of making the final copy of a document).  The package can
also make multiple indexes; it can do the job in the conventional
([`multind`](https://ctan.org/pkg/multind)) way, or by using the external
`splitindex` script provided with the [`splitindex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/splitindex)
package.  (This arrangement allows efficient operation with small
numbers of indexes, while retaining the flexibility of permitting
large numbers of indexes without hitting the restriction of numbers of
active output streams.)

The [`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) class has its own multiple-index functionality (as
well as its own index layout options, which other packages delegate to
the index style used by `makeindex`).
