# Formatting a thesis in LaTeX

Thesis styles are usually very specific to your University, so it's
usually not profitable to ask around for a package outside your own
University.  Since many Universities (in their eccentric way) still
require double-spaced thesis text, you may also need separately to set
up [double spacing](./FAQ-linespace.html).

If you want to write a new thesis class of your own, a good place to
start is the University of California style, but remember that it's
often difficult to produce a thesis that both looks good and conforms
with the style that your Univeristy demands.
