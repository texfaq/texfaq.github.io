# Indent after section headings

LaTeX implements a style that doesn't indent the first paragraph
after a section heading.  There are coherent reasons for this, but not
everyone likes it.
The [`indentfirst`](http://ctan.org/pkg/indentfirst) package
suppresses the mechanism, so that the first paragraph is
indented.
