# Setting papers for journals

Publishers of journals have a wide range of requirements for the
presentation of papers, and while many publishers do accept electronic
submissions in (La)TeX, they don't often submit recommended macros to
public archives.

Nevertheless, there are considerable numbers of macros of one sort or
another available on CTAN; searching for your journal name in
the CTAN catalogue&nbsp;&mdash; see 
[searching CTAN](./FAQ-findfiles.html))&nbsp;&mdash;
may well turn up what you're seeking.

Failing that, you may be well advised to contact the prospective
publisher of your paper; many publishers have macros on their own web
sites, or otherwise available only upon application.

Check that the publisher is offering you macros suitable to an
environment you can use: a few still have no macros for current
LaTeX, for example, claiming that LaTeX 2.09 is good enough&hellip;

Some publishers rekey anything sent them anyway, so that it doesn't
really matter what macros you use.  Others merely encourage you to use
as few extensions of a standard package as possible, so that they will
find it easy to transform your paper to their own internal form.
