Lamport never recommended how one should pronounce LaTeX, but a lot
of people pronounce it "Lay TeX" or perhaps "Lah TeX" (with
TeX pronounced as the program itself; see
[the rules for TeX](FAQ-TeXpronounce)).  It is definitely
_not_ to be pronounced in the same way as the rubber-tree gum
(which would be "lay teks").

The LaTeX2e logo is supposed to end with an
&epsilon;; nevertheless, most
people pronounce the name as "LaTeX-two-ee".
