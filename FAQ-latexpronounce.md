# How should I pronounce ''LaTeX(2<sub>&epsilon;</sub>)''?

Lamport never recommended how one should pronounce LaTeX, but a lot
of people pronounce it 'Lay TeX' or perhaps 'Lah TeX' (with
TeX pronounced as the program itself; see
[the rules for TeX](./FAQ-TeXpronounce.html)).  It is definitely
_not_ to be pronounced in the same way as the rubber-tree gum
(which would be 'lay teks').

The LaTeX 2e logo is supposed to end with an
&epsilon;; nevertheless, most
people pronounce the name as 'LaTeX-two-ee'.
