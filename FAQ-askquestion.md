# How to ask a question

You want help from the community at large; you've decided where you're
going to [ask your question](./FAQ-gethelp.html), but how do you
phrase it?

Excellent ''general'' advice (how to ask questions of anyone) is
contained in
[Eric Raymond's article on the topic](http://catb.org/&nbsp;esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
Eric's an extremely self-confident person, and this comes through in
his advice; but his guidelines are very good, even for us in the
un-self-confident majority.  It's important to remember that you don't
have a right to advice from the world, but that if you express
yourself well, you will usually find someone who will be pleased to
help.

So how do you express yourself in the (La)TeX world?  There aren't
any comprehensive rules, but a few guidelines may help in the
application of your own common sense.
  

-  Make sure you're asking the right people.  Don't ask in a TeX
    forum about printer device drivers for the `Foobar`
    operating system.  Yes, TeX users need printers, but no, TeX
    users will typically _not_ be `Foobar` systems
    managers.
  

    Similarly, avoid posing a question in a language that the majority
    of the group don't use: post in Ruritanian to
    `de.comp.text.tex` and you may have a long wait before a
    German- and Ruritanian-speaking TeX expert notices your
    question.
-  If your question is (or may be) TeX-system-specific, report
    what system you're using, or intend to use: ''I can't install
    TeX'' is as good as useless, whereas ''I'm trying to install the
    `mumbleTeX` distribution on the `Grobble`
    operating system'' gives all the context a potential respondent
    might need.  Another common situation where this information is
    important is when you're having trouble installing something new in
    your system: ''I want to add the [`glugtheory`](http://ctan.org/pkg/glugtheory) package to my
    `mumbleTeX v12.0` distribution on the `Grobble 2024`
    operating system''.
-  If you need to know how to do something, make clear what your
    environment is: ''I want to do _x_ in Plain TeX'', or ''I
    want to do _y_ in LaTeX running the [`boggle`](http://ctan.org/pkg/boggle)
    class''.  If you thought you knew how, but your attempts are
    failing, tell us what you've tried: ''I've already tried installing
    the [`elephant`](http://ctan.org/pkg/elephant) in the [`minicar`](http://ctan.org/pkg/minicar) directory, and it
    didn't work, even after refreshing the filename database''.
-  If something's going wrong within (La)TeX, pretend you're
    [submitting a LaTeX bug report](./FAQ-latexbug.html),
    and try to generate a [minimum failing example](./FAQ-minxampl.html).
    If your example 
    needs your local [`xyzthesis`](http://ctan.org/pkg/xyzthesis) class, or some other resource
    not generally available, be sure to include a pointer to how the
    resource can be obtained.
-  Figures are special, of course.  Sometimes the figure itself is
    _really_ needed, but most problems may be demonstrated with a
    ''figure substitute'' in the form of a
    `\rule{width}{height}` command, for some value of
    &lsaquo;_width_&rsaquo; and &lsaquo;_height_&rsaquo;.  If the (real) figure is needed,
    don't try posting it: far better to put it on the web somewhere.
-  Be as succinct as possible.  Your helpers don't usually need to
    know _why_ you're doing something, just _what_ you're
    doing and where the problem is.
