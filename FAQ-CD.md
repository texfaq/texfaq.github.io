# The TeX collection

If you don't have access to the Internet, there are obvious
attractions to TeX collections on a disc.  Even those with net
access will find large quantities of TeX-related files to hand a
great convenience.

The TeX collection provides this, together with
ready-to-run TeX systems for various architectures.  The collection
is distributed on DVD, and contains:
  

-  The TeX&nbsp;Live distribution, including the programs themselves
    compiled for a variety of architectures; TeX&nbsp;Live may be
    run from the DVD or installed on hard disc.
-  MacTeX: an easy to install TeX system for MacOS/X, based
    on TeX&nbsp;Live; this distribution includes a native Mac installer,
    [the TeXShop front-end](http://www.uoregon.edu/&nbsp;koch/texshop/)
    and other Mac-specific tools;
-  ProTeXt: an easy to install TeX system for Windows, based
    on MiKTeX, based on an 'active' document that guides
    installation; and
-  A snapshot of CTAN.

A fair number of national TeX User Groups, as well as TUG,
distribute copies to their members at no extra charge.  Some user
groups are also able to sell additional copies:
contact your local user group or [TUG](./FAQ-TUG*.html).

You may also download disc images from CTAN; the installation
disc, ProTeXt and MacTeX are all separately available.  Beware:
they are all pretty large downloads.  TeX&nbsp;Live, once installed, may
be updated online.

More details of the collection are available from
  [its own web page](http://www.tug.org/texcollection/)
  on the TUG site.
