# (La)TeX tutorials

The AMS publishes a ''Short Math Guide for LaTeX'', which is
available (in several formats) via
[http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html] (the ''Additional
Documentation'' about half-way down the page.

Herbert Vo&szlig; has written an extensive guide to mathematics in
LaTeX, and a development of it has been 
[published as a book](./FAQ-latex-books.html).

Two documents written more than ten years apart about font usage in
TeX are worth reading: 
[Essential NFSS](http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb14-2/tb39rahtz-nfss.pdf)
by Sebastian Rahtz, and 
[Font selection in LaTeX](http://tug.org/pracjourn/2006-1/schmidt/schmidt.pdf),
cast in the form of an FAQ, by Walter Schmidt.  A general
compendium of font information (including the two above) may be found
on the [TUG web site](http://www.tug.org/fonts/).

TUG India is developing a series of online LaTeX tutorials
which can be strongly recommended: select single chapters at a time
from [http://www.tug.org/tutorials/tugindia]&nbsp;&mdash; there
are 17&nbsp;chapters in the series, two of which are mostly introductory.

Peter Smith's
  ''[LaTeX for Logicians](http://www.logicmatters.net/latex-for-logicians/)''
page covers a rather smaller subject area, but is similarly comprehensive
(mostly by links to documents on relevant topics, rather than as a
monolithic document).

Keith Reckdahl's ''Using Imported Graphics in LaTeX 2e''
([`epslatex`](http://ctan.org/pkg/epslatex)) is an
excellent introduction to graphics use.  It's available on
CTAN, but not in the TeX&nbsp;Live or MiKTeX distributions, for
lack of sources.

Stefan Kottwitz manages a web site devoted to the use of the drawing
packages 
[PGF and TikZ](./FAQ-drawing.html), 
[http://www.texample.net/]

Included is 
 [examples catalogue](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/)
includes examples (with output) from the package documentation as well
as code written by the original site maintainer (Kjell Magne Fauske)
and others.

The compendious PGF/TikZ manual is clear, but is
bewildering for some beginners.  The 
['minimal' introduction](http://cremeronline.com/LaTeX/minimaltikz.pdf)
has helped at least the present author.

Vincent Zoonekynd provides a set of excellent (and graphic) tutorials
on the programming of 
[title page styles](http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_title/0.html),
[chapter heading styles](http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_chapter/0.html)
and
[section heading styles](http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_section/0.html).
In each file, there is a selection of graphics representing an output
style, and for each style, the code that produces it is shown.

An invaluable step-by-step setup guide for establishing a ''work
flow'' through your (La)TeX system, so that output appears at the
correct size and position on standard-sized paper, and that the print
quality is satisfactory, is Mike Shell's [`testflow`](http://ctan.org/pkg/testflow).  The
tutorial consists of a large plain text document, and there is a
supporting LaTeX file together with correct output, both in PostScript and
PDF, for each of A4 and ''letter'' paper sizes.  The
complete kit is available on CTAN (distributed with the
author's macros for papers submitted for IEEE publications).
The issues are also covered in a later 
[FAQ answer](./FAQ-dvips-pdf.html).

Documentation of Japanese &Omega; use appears in
Haruhiko Okumura's page
[typesetting Japanese with Omega](http://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/&nbsp;okumura/texfaq/japanese/)
(the parent page is in Japanese, so out of the scope of this
FAQ list).

Some university departments make their local documentation available
on the web.  Most straightforwardly, there's the simple translation of
existing documentation into HTML, for example the INFO
documentation of the (La)TeX installation, of which a sample is the
LaTeX documentation available at
[http://www.tac.dk/cgi-bin/info2www?(latex)]

More ambitiously, some university departments have enthusiastic
documenters who 
make public record of their (La)TeX support.  For example, Tim Love
(of Cambridge University Engineering Department) maintains his
department's pages at
[http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/]
